## Files

### Median of Two Sorted Arrays

This file contains a function `findMedianSortedArrays` Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.. Please complete the function according to the instructions in the file. 

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

### `task2.py`

This file contains a class `Person` with some attributes and methods. Please complete the class according to the instructions in the file.

### `task3.py`

This file contains a function `reverse_words` that takes in a string `s` as an argument and returns a string with the words in reverse order. Please complete the function according to the instructions in the file.

### `test_task1.py`, `test_task2.py`, `test_task3.py`

These files contain unit tests for the corresponding tasks. Please ensure that your code passes all the tests before submitting your solution.

## Submission

Please ensure that you have completed all the tasks and that your code passes all the tests before submitting your solution. When you are ready, create a pull request to the original repository with your changes. We will review your code and get back to you as soon as possible.
